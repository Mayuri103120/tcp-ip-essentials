# Welcome to the Internet Architecture and Protocols Lab!

On this page, I'm going to answer some basic questions about how this course will run.

## Lab materials

#### Where will the lab materials be shared?

The lab section of the course has its own Brightspace site (it is separate from the lecture section), so first, make sure you are in the lab section's site! Then, find the "Content" menu item and click on it. On the left side of the Content screen, you will see a list of modules, and you can click on them one at a time to see the materials for that module. There will be a new module each week, and it will become visible in Brightspace after the lecture for that week.

Within the module for each lab, you will find:

* A lab manual, with step-by-step instructions for completing the lab assignment
* A video playlist that you can watch to see the instructor doing each step of the lab assignment
* A link to a survey that you can fill out to give us feedback about the lab assignment. Please fill this out, it's really helpful to us!

## Lab sessions

#### Will I need to attend any lab sessions in person?

No, the lab will run 100% online.

#### Do I need to attend online sessions at a certain time, or can I complete the lab assignment at a time that is convenient for me?

Use the material in the Content module for that week to complete the lab assignment at whatever time is convenient for you. Just make sure that you leave plenty of time to finish the lab before the deadline, even if you run into some unexpected problems! 

#### How can I get help or ask questions about the lab material?

There are two ways to get help:

* Post a question on the Q&A forum for this course.
* Attend a Zoom office hours session with the instructor or a course assistant. 

#### How long should I expect to spend on each lab assignment?

To understand the time commitment associated with this lab, it may help to have some historical background! The Internet Architecture and Protocols course used to require an in-person lab in addition to the in-person lecture. The lab session was scheduled as a weekly 3 hour 40 minute time slot, and students worked in teams to execute the lab experiment during that time. (The 3 hour and 40 minute time slot did not necessarily include time to prepare for the lab experiment by reading the instructions, which students were expected to do in advance, or the time to analyze the results and write the lab report after completing the experiment.)

In the online lab, you'll run exactly the same experiments that students used to do in those 3 hour 40 minute in-person sessions. However, it may take more or less time than 3 hours and 40 minutes -

* the average student should probably expect to spend 3-4 hours each week working on the lab experiment.
* if you have previous experience with network protocols and the Linux networking utilities, you will probably not need the full 3-4 hours each week. 
* if you are not as comfortable with network protocols and the Linux networking utilities, you may need more than the 3-4 hours usually allotted to complete the experiment.

Also note that this does not necessarily include time to prepare for the lab (by reviewing the instructions and the relevant book chapter in advance) and the time to analyze results and answer the questions in Gradescope.

If you find that you are spending much more than 3-4 hours per week on the lab, please reach out to the lab instructor to ask for help (via Zoom office hours or the Q&A site)! We can discuss the situation to find out what is taking so long, and help you make any necessary adjustments. (Don't wait until the end of the semester - ask for help as soon as you notice the problem, so we can help you as quickly as possible.)


## Collaboration/academic integrity

#### Can I ask for help with the lab assignment or with the answers to the lab report questions on Gradescope?

You can ask for help on our course Q&A site or during Zoom office hours. When you ask questions on the Q&A site, other students who have a similar problem will also benefit from the answer!

You are not allowed to ask for help on Chegg, CourseHero, private messages or group messages with other students, or in other online forums. 

#### Can I work on the lab assignment together with another student?

You can work on the lab assignment at the same time as another student, and discuss your results as you work. But,

* You must set up your own resources on GENI and run the lab exercise yourself - you are not allowed to use another student's account or resources in another student's GENI "slice". Also, you aren't allowed to type commands into another student's terminal. 
* You must submit data and screenshots from your own execution of the lab - you are not allowed to submit another student's data. Also, you must annotate screenshots etc. yourself - you are not allowed to ask another student to do it for you.
* You must answer the questions in Gradescope yourself. You are not allowed to share the answers with another student.

#### Can I use outside resources, such as reference materials or lab reports from previous semesters?

It may be helpful to use reference materials, such as the textbook, lab manual, or online resource, when you answer questions in the lab report. (Especially for questions that ask you to "explain" some phenomenon!) However, if you use outside resources without disclosing their use, it is considered plagiarism. To avoid plagiarism when using reference materials:

* If you write the answer in your own words, but used the reference material to help you arrive at the answer, you should cite the reference material (e.g. give the URL, of the name and page of the textbook).
* If you use the exact words of the reference material, you should put the words in quotes (to show that you are using the exact words) and also cite the reference material (e.g. give the URL, of the name and page of the textbook).
* If you use an outside reference to answer a question, make sure you answer the specific question that is asked, and only that! Students often earn a poor grade when quoting an outside reference (even with citation!) because they copied a lot of material that doesn't directly answer the question. This demonstrates a lack of understanding of the question and its answer. Make sure you write a clear and concise answer that directly answers the question.

You may have seen lab reports from previous semesters (either from friends, or online). You are not permitted to use these. We make updates and corrections to the lab procedure and questions every semester, so you shouldn't use previous lab reports even just to see what the answers should look like (for example - to see what parts of a screenshot to annotate), since these details often change from one semester to the next.

## Submitting Lab Work

#### What do I need to submit after each lab exercise? Do I need to write a report?

As your work on each lab exercise, you'll answer some short questions by filling in your answers in an online form in Gradescope. 

Here's a brief tutorial to show you how it works:

#### Where will I submit my lab work?

You will submit all your work on Gradescope. To open Gradescope from Brightspace, click on Content, then Course Tools, then Gradescope.

#### How do I join this course on Gradescope?

In Brightspace, click on Content, then Course Tools, then Gradescope. This will prompt you to create an account or sign into your account (if you have one already), and then it will automatically add you to our course on Gradescope.


#### Why are there two due dates for each assignment in Gradescope?


Each assignment has two due dates in Gradescope - a regular due date and a "late" due date.

* Your work is due by the regular due date.
* If you submit (or resubmit) your work within a few hours after the regular due date, it will be marked "LATE" in Gradescope. However, there won't be any penalty for a submission that is only a few hours late.
* "One free late pass" policy: For *one* lab assignment this semester, if exceptional and unanticipated circumstances prevent you from submitting your work before the regular due date - for example, if you are sick - you may submit after the regular due date, but before the "late" due date. You don't have to ask permission or let me know when you are using your "late pass", but you can only use it once during the semester.
* Once the late due date passes, Gradescope will close submissions and you will not be able to submit your work for that assignment.
* If you experience technical problems while working on a lab, make sure to ask for help (on the Q&A site) *before* the regular due date, so that you can get help and submit your work before Gradescope closes submissions! Even if you are using your "late pass", make sure that you give yourself enough time before submissions are closed to get help in case of technical issues. Don't wait to ask for help until it's too late to submit.


#### Can I make corrections or resubmit my work after I submit a lab report in Gradescope?

Yes, you can make corrections and resubmit as many times as you want until the regular due date.

#### Yes, you can make corrections and resubmit as many times as you want until the regular due date.

You can review your graded work in Gradescope and see exactly why you lost points. Here's a video that shows how it works:

#### What should I do if I think that my work was not graded correctly?

Use the Regrade Request feature in Gradescope, which will automatically send a message to the TA or instructor that graded that specific question. Here's a video that shows how it works:

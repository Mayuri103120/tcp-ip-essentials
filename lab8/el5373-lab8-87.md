## 8.7 HTTP exercises

Review the slice details in the GENI Portal and find the hostname assigned to the "website" host. For example, in the following screenshot, the hostname is `website.nat.ch-geni-net.instageni.research.umich.edu`:

### Exercise 2

In this exercise, we will use `telnet` to manually write and send an HTTP request, and observe the response from the HTTP server.

While

```
sudo tcpdump -i eth1 -w http-$(hostname -s).pcap
```

is running on the "gateway", run

```
telnet website.nat.ch-geni-net.instageni.research.umich.edu 80
```

on a "client" node, but substitue the hostname of your own "website" host. You should see the following indication of a successful connection:

```
Trying 199.109.64.53...
Connected to pcvm2-3.instageni.nysernet.org.
Escape character is '^]'.
```

(but with a different address and hostname.)

At the console, type the following HTTP request line by line:

```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.0
From: guest@client
User-Agent: HTTPTool/1.0

```

Note that you need to type "Enter" to input the last line, which is blank, and then "Enter" again to send it.

When the `telnet` process is terminated, save the output for your lab report. Identify the HTTP response header, and the HTML file sent from the HTTP server.

Terminate `tcpdump` and transfer the packet capture to your laptop with `scp`. Analyze the captured HTTP packets. 

**Lab report**: Show the HTTP request and response headers.

### Exercise 3

With HTTP 1.0, connections are not considered persistent unless a keepalive header is included. If a client supports keepalive, it includes the following in its request header:

```
Connection: Keep-Alive
```

When the server receives this request, if it supports keepalive it will include a similar line in the response header.

Then, if the client sends another request - for example, for resources linked from the initial page it requests - it will reuse the same TCP connection.

The "Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page" includes a linked image, and when we request this page using a conventional web browser (e.g. Firefox, Chrome), it will send two HTTP requests: one for the HTML page, and then another one for the linked image. In this exercise, we will observe the behavior with and without the KeepAlive directive.

By default, the KeepAlive directive is enabled on the Apache web server, so our first experiment will involve observing the behavior with KeepAlive on. On "website", run

```
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w http-keepalive-on-$(hostname -s).pcap "tcp port 80"
```

Note that

* We are monitoring on the "control" interface (`eth0`), not the "experiment" interface where we usually observe traffic. In this instance, we will generate traffic over the "control" interface by loading the web page from a browser on our laptop.
* We are filtering the `tcpdump` to only capture traffic on TCP port 80 (the HTTP port), otherwise the packet capture would be full of our SSH traffic, which is also carried through the "control" interface.

On your laptop, open a browser in "private" or "incognito" mode. (This is necessary so that the browser will load the page from the server, rather than using a cached version from a previous visit.)

Put the hostname of the "website" node from _your_ slice in the address bar of a browser on your own laptop, and verify that the "Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page" loads:

Close your private/incognito browser window. Terminate `tcpdump` and transfer the packet capture to your laptop with `scp`.

Next, we will turn off KeepAlive support on the web server and repeat the experiment. On "website", run

```
sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```

to open the Apache configuration file. Find the line that says

```
KeepAlive On
```

and change it to

```
KeepAlive Off
```

Then, use Ctrl+O to save the file - you will see a prompt to accept the file name, hit Enter to confirm - and then Ctrl+X to exit `nano`. Restart Apache with the new configuration:

```
sudo service apache2 restart
```

Now, on "website", run

```
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w http-keepalive-off-$(hostname -s).pcap "tcp port 80"
```

Open a _new_ private/incognito browser window. Put the hostname from _your_ slice in the address bar of a browser on your own laptop, and verify that the "Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page" loads:

![](http-pageload.png)

Close your private/incognito browser window. Terminate `tcpdump` and transfer the packet capture to your laptop with `scp`.

**Note**: Students have reported problems using Microsoft Edge for this exercise - some Edge browser versions don't signal keepalive support in the HTTP header. I recommend using a Chrome, Firefox, or Safari browser instead. If your browser doesn't support keepalive, and you see the same number of TCP connections with and without keepalive, that's OK - just make sure you show that the *server* headers show that it does not support keepalive, in the scenario where you turn off keepalive.



**Lab report**: With the KeepAlive directive enabled (default case), how many HTTP GET requests were sent? Which files were requested? Show all HTTP request and response headers. 

In Wireshark, use the "Statistics > Flow Graph" display to analyze your TCP connection. (Include the flow graph in your lab report.) How many TCP connections were used to retrieve the page and linked assets? How many SYN packets did you observe? What were the TCP port numbers used for the HTTP request and response for each file?


**Lab report**: With the KeepAlive directive _disabled_, how many HTTP GET requests were sent? Which files were requested? Show all HTTP request and response headers. What is different between this HTTP response header and the previous one?

In Wireshark, use the "Statistics > Flow Graph" display to analyze your TCP connection. (Include the flow graph in your lab report.) How many TCP connections were used to retrieve the page and linked assets? How many SYN packets did you observe? What were the TCP port numbers used for the HTTP request and response for each file?

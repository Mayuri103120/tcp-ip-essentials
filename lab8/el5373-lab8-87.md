## HTTP exercises

For this experiment, you will need two hosts on GENI, and one of them should be configured a web server.

* If you still have access to resources from the "Basic home gateway services: DHCP, DNS, NAT" experiment, AND they are still configured as decribed there (including NAT), you can use one client node and the webserver from that experiment.
* Alternatively, if you have lost access to those resources, reserve two nodes for this experiment using the following Rspec: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ffund/tcp-ip-essentials/gh-pages/rspecs/two-hosts-one-public.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ffund/tcp-ip-essentials/gh-pages/rspecs/two-hosts-one-public.xml). On the webserver, install Apache2:

```
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get -y install apache2  
```


Review the slice details in the GENI Portal and find the hostname assigned to the "website" host. For example, in the following screenshot, the hostname is `website.nat.ch-geni-net.instageni.research.umich.edu`:

### Exercise: send an HTTP request with telnet


In this exercise, we will use `telnet` to manually write and send an HTTP request, and observe the response from the HTTP server.

If you are using the network topology with a gateway, run

```
sudo tcpdump -i eth1 -w http-$(hostname -s).pcap 'tcp port 80'
```

on the "gateway". If you are using the topology with just one client and the web server, run

```
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w http-$(hostname -s).pcap 'tcp port 80'
```

on the client 

While this is running, run

```
telnet website.nat.ch-geni-net.instageni.research.umich.edu 80
```

on a "client" node, but substitute the hostname of your own "website" host. You should see the following indication of a successful connection:

```
Trying 199.109.64.53...
Connected to pcvm2-3.instageni.nysernet.org.
Escape character is '^]'.
```

(but with a different address and hostname.)

At the console, type the following HTTP request line by line:

```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.0
From: guest@client
User-Agent: HTTPTool/1.0

```

Note that you need to type "Enter" to input the last line, which is blank, and then "Enter" again to send it.

When the `telnet` process is terminated, save the output for your lab report. Identify the HTTP response header, and the HTML file sent from the HTTP server.

Terminate `tcpdump` and transfer the packet capture to your laptop with `scp`. Analyze the captured HTTP packets. 

**Lab report**: Show the HTTP request and response *headers* (only the headers!). 

**Lab report**: In the HTTP response header, identify these key elements:

* the version of the HTTP protocol
* the status code and the status message (for a successful HTTP request, the standard is "200 OK")
* the header fields that indicate the type of file that is returned, and its length
